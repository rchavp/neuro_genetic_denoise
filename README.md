# Neuro Genetic Denoise Experiment

This project is a virtual lab to experiment with Autoencoder Denoising neural nets, using a genetic learning approach.

I decided to implement my own genetic network for the time being because of the degrees of freedom it provides when selecting the overall parameters of the whole system. Since Autoencoder nets divert from ordinary abstraction based nets, this freedom will leverage the subsequent paths to follow once I gather enough data to assess the most appropriate ones. It is worth mentioneing that this is a one way trip where we destination is yet unknown.

For later stages and depending on the aforementioned factors I nmay decide to introduce a more manistream neural net framework.

**Note: Unfortunately there is a non trivial amount of math involved here, but the concepts are still very much reachable if you are really interested in learning them.
